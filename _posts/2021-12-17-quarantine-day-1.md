Day 1 of quarantine. Currently watching "There will be blood". Good movie. Precursor to some combination of Hereditrary (story flow not horror aspect). Spans huge number of years and length of movie is paced so. Tracks the lifetime of one man, his son, a pastor tangential, and their fortune from oil in the early 1900s
